### If it fails, is there a way for it to try again?

this is mostly aimed at implementing, or delegating tasks to workers

### Are there any single points of failures?
if an API or service become unavailable would it stop the rest of the class from finishing what it needs to do?
or can it complete and come back to that later?

### If it fails, is there a human readable error/explanation?

are you rescuing possible failpoints and giving an explanation?

Are there comments within the code to describe what is happening?

what if you were to move onto another project/company or if you become ill, can someone other than yourself understand what is happening?

Are the tests adequate?
do they only check for passing cases
do they check for failures too?
