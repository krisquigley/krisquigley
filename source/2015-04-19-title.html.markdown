  <h3>If it fails, is there a way for it to try again?</h3>
  <p>- this is mostly aimed at implementing, or delegating tasks to workers</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Are there any single points of failures?</h3>
  <p>- if an API or service become unavailable would it stop the rest of the class from finishing what it needs to do?<br/> -or can it complete and come back to that later? </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>If it fails, is there a human readable error/explanation?</h3>
  <p>- are you rescuing possible failpoints and giving an explanation?</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Are there comments within the code to describe what is happening?</h3>
  <p>- what if you were to move onto another project/company or if you become ill, can someone other than yourself understand what is happening?</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Are the tests adequate?</h3>
  <p>- do they only check for passing cases<br/> - do they check for failures too?</p>
